- 🎯 **Smart Routing**: Automatic categorization (Technical, Billing, General)
- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects customer sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- 🔄 **LangGraph Workflows**: State-based conversation management
- 🚀 **Production Ready**: FastAPI backend with NGINX reverse proxy
- 📊 **Real-time & REST APIs**: WebSocket and HTTP endpoints

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

### **1. Backend Directory (`backend/`):**

This folder contains the server-side code and logic for your application.

* **agents/**:

  * This folder likely contains modules related to the **AI agents** that handle specific tasks in your app. AI agents are components that process requests, make decisions, and interact with the user or other parts of the system.

* **config/**:

  * This folder is for **configuration files**. These files contain the settings that determine how the application behaves (e.g., API keys, database settings).

* **database/**:

  * This folder is where the database-related code is located. It handles things like storing and retrieving data from a database. **ChromaDB** is likely the database system you're using here for storing and managing information.

* **models/**:

  * This folder contains the **data models**. Models are Python classes that define how data is structured and stored in the application (e.g., user data, support queries).

* **workflows/**:

  * This folder likely contains **LangGraph workflows**, which is a framework for defining how various tasks or processes are handled in your application, like routing or processing different types of requests.

* **main.py**:

  * This is usually the **main entry point** for the application. When you run your application, this file will be executed to start the backend server (in this case, it uses **FastAPI**, a web framework for building APIs).

* **data/**:

  * This folder stores **data files** related to your application, like pre-trained models, configuration data, or other resources needed by your app.

* **requirements.txt**:

  * This is a **dependencies file** that lists all the external libraries and tools needed to run your application. You install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in Python.

* **.env.example**:

  * This file contains a template for **environment variables**. Environment variables are used to store sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. You would copy this file to `.env` and fill in your specific settings.

---

### **2. Frontend Directory (`frontend/`):**

This folder contains the **client-side** part of the application, which is what the user interacts with.

* **index.html**:

  * This is the **main webpage** of your application. It's the HTML file that gets loaded when a user opens the website in their browser.

* **static/**:

  * This folder contains **static files** like **CSS** (styles), **JavaScript** (scripts), and **images**. These files are necessary for styling and interactivity in the web application.

---

### **3. Deployment Directory (`deployment/`):**

This folder contains the files related to deploying and running the application on a cloud server (e.g., AWS EC2).

* **ec2/**:

  * This folder contains **deployment files** specific to setting up and running your application on an **AWS EC2 instance** (a virtual machine in the cloud).

  * **setup.sh**:

    * A **bash script** that automates the setup of the application on the server. It will install necessary dependencies, configure the server, and set up your application.

  * **nginx/**:

    * Contains **NGINX configuration files**. **NGINX** is a web server that serves your web pages and acts as a **reverse proxy** to forward requests to the backend.

  * **systemd/**:

    * Contains files related to **systemd**, which is used to manage services on Linux systems. Here, it would manage the backend service, ensuring it runs continuously in the background (e.g., the FastAPI application).

---

### **In Summary:**

* **Backend**: Deals with the logic, database, AI processing, and workflows that power your application.
* **Frontend**: Deals with the user interface (UI) and client-side behavior (what users see and interact with).
* **Deployment**: Contains files for setting up and running your application on a cloud platform like **AWS EC2**, including configuring web servers and background services.

---

This structure helps separate different parts of the application for easier development, testing, and maintenance.
